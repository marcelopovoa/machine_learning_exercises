## Estimating House Prices (Regression)
Regression estimating house prices based on previous house sales, using features like house size (sqft), number of bathrooms and so on...


## Product sentiment analysis (Classification)
Analysis of Amazon product reviews estimating if the reviews were positive or negative, as well as picking the most positive and most negative reviews.


## Which Wikipedia article would be similar to one you just read (Clustering)
Clustering wikipedia articles of people aiming at finding the ones most similar to each one.


## Product recommender: songs (Recommender)
Based on a dataset of songs listed by users, get song recommendations per user and also check which songs are being recommended the most.


## Deep learning for image retrieval (Deep learning)
Using a dataset with animals, compare raw pixel vs deep learning classifiers. Then use nearest neighbor models to get predictions and calculate its accuracy.


## Estimating House Prices (Simple Regression) - Manual calculation
Regression estimating house prices based on previous house sales, using features like house size (sqft), number of bathrooms and so on...
This time the simple linear model and RSS are manually calculated instead of using a model from a python package.


## Estimating House Prices (Multiple Regression) - Manual calculation
Regression estimating house prices based on previous house sales, using features like house size (sqft), number of bathrooms and so on...
We calculate the linear model and RSS manually for a multiple regression case instead of using python packages.


## Estimating House Prices (Multiple Regression) - Manual Gradient Descent Calculation
Regression estimating house prices based on previous house sales, using features like house size (sqft), number of bathrooms and so on...
We manually calculate the Gradient Descent of the regression algorithm for multiple regression cases.
